notes:
in signing up for each one of the patients/doctors/nurses, theres a verifcation code given to them by the hospital:
code doctor: 6578
code nurse: 8756
code patient: 9856
that way we made sure a patient wont sign up as a doctor and vice versa...
then once the user is signed up his information and account information will be inserted into our mongodb database.
to connect to our mongodb database , u can use this link:
mongodb+srv://m7mddacca:m7md123@cluster0.4hynvpk.mongodb.net/test
then you have to run nodemon app.js in the vscode terminal and check out localhost:3824 on your browser
